\details{
Drasgow et al. (1985) introduced one of the most used person-fit statistics, \code{lz}. This statistic is the standardized log-likelihood of the respondent's response vector. \code{lz} is (supposed to be) asymptotically standard normally distributed. 

The computation of \code{lz} requires that both item and ability parameters are available. Function \code{lz} allows to user to enter his/her own item and ability parameter estimates (variables \code{IP} and \code{Ability}, respectively). Alternatively, \code{lz} relies on functions available through the \code{\link{irtoys}} package for estimating the parameters. Specifically, the user can choose one from three possible IRT models to fit the data: \code{IRT.PModel="1PL"}, \code{IRT.PModel="2PL"}, or \code{IRT.PModel="3PL"}. As for estimating the ability parameters there are three possible methods: \code{Ability.PModel="ML"} (maximum likelihood), \code{Ability.PModel="BM"} (Bayes modal), or \code{Ability.PModel="WL"} (weighted likelihood).

It was later observed by several researchers (e.g., Molenaar and Hoijtink, 1990) that the asymptotic approximation only holds when true ability values are used. This limitation was overcome by Snijders (2001), who further developed \code{lz} into the \code{lzstar} statistic. An accessible paper that thoroughly explains the basic principles behind \code{lzstar} is Magis, Raiche, and Beland (2012). It is important to realize that not all item and/or ability estimation procedures can be used when computing \code{lzstar}. In particular, the estimation of the ability parameters is constrained (see Snijders, 2001, Equation 5). The \code{lzstar} algorithm internally estimates the ability parameters accordingly for one of three possible methods: \code{Ability.PModel="ML"} (maximum likelihood), \code{Ability.PModel="BM"} (Bayes modal), or \code{Ability.PModel="WL"} (weighted likelihood), see Magis et al. (2012). The user may provide his or her own ability estimates in case they are available by means of other software. In this case it is necessary to specify the method that was used for the estimation (ML, BM, or WL) using the argument \code{Ability.PModel}.

Aberrant response behavior is (potentially) indicated by small values of lz/lzstar (i.e., in the left tail of the sampling distribution).

Missing values in \code{matrix} are imputed by one of three single imputation methods: Hotdeck imputation (\code{NA.method = "Hotdeck"}), nonparametric model imputation (\code{NA.method = "NPModel"}), and parametric model imputation (\code{NA.method = "PModel"}); see Zhang and Walker (2008). 
\itemize{
\item Hotdeck imputation replaces missing responses of an examinee ('recipient') by item scores from the examinee which is closest to the recipient ('donor'), based on the recipient's nonmissing item scores. The similarity between nonmissing item scores of recipients and donors is based on the sum of absolute differences between the corresponding item scores. The donor's response pattern is deemed to be the most similar to the recipient's response pattern in the group, so item scores of the former are used to replace the corresponding missing values of the latter. When multiple donors are equidistant to a recipient, one donor is randomly drawn from the set of all donors.
\item The nonparametric model imputation method is similar to the hotdeck imputation, but item scores are generated from Bernoulli distributions with probabilities defined by donors with similar total score than the recipient (based on all items except the NAs).
\item The parametric model imputation method is similar to the hotdeck imputation, but item scores are generated from Bernoulli distributions with probabilities estimated by means of parametric IRT models (\code{IRT.PModel = "1PL"}, \code{"2PL"}, or \code{"3PL"}). Item parameters (\code{IP}) and ability parameters (\code{Ability}) may be provided for this purpose (otherwise the algorithm finds estimates for these parameters).
